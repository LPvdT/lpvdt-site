	"profile": "Senior Data Platform \\& MLOps Engineer with a track record of building data systems from the ground up and guiding them into fully automated, production-grade platforms. My career began at the intersection of econometrics and software engineering as a freelance developer, progressed into data science and advanced analytics, and has since evolved into leading machine learning and MLOps initiatives at scale. I bring a unique blend of engineering craftsmanship and quantitative expertise, backed by an MSc with a solid econometric background. Whether designing architectures, operationalizing ML, or mentoring teams, I focus on turning complex data problems into solutions that deliver long-term value. Academic excellence (both theses graded 9/10) underscores a commitment to precision, while open-source contributions and continuous learning reflect my drive to stay ahead in a rapidly changing field. % Experience \\newpage",
